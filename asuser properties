asuser enables peer-to-peer delegated execution:

You stay logged in as yourself

A command runs as another non-root user

Only single commands

Consent is proven by target user’s password

No shells, no sudo replacement, no root delegation

Full transparency and per-user audit logs


just a learning experience not a replacement of any existing tool
